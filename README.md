# metagenomics-otu-plotter
A shell plotting function that extends a ruby framework and plots the metagenomics abundances right in your shell for checking the abundance distribution. It takes the OTU metagenomics abundances and then plot the bar and the histogram to see the distribution of the abundances. just run it and it will ask for the file and plots to make. 

```
i am your shell plotter that uses ruby for the plotting for plotting the metagenomics abundances
gem install youplot
you have a series of the abundances or just a single file, if a single abundance then only bar and hist plot is possible
enter the filename for the metagenomics abundance:taxonomy_OTUs
enter the type of the plot:bar
enter the number of the bins:
prepairing the file for the plotting
       bar plot analysis of the metagenomics samples OTUs
